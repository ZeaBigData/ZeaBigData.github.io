Datasets assessing chromatin accessibility.

## Chromatin Accessibility in Maize

### MNase

1. Developing B73 ears were subjected to mild, intermediate, and severe MNase treatment.  
Data available in SRA, not summarized, from [Gent et al., 2015](http://www.genetics.org/content/200/4/1105)

2. Shoot and root tissue of 9 day post-germination B73 seedlings subjected to heavy and light digestion with MNase from [Rogers-Melnick et al., 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/E3177.long). 
Summarized hypersensitive region [data](http://cbsusrv04.tc.cornell.edu/users/panzea/download.aspx?filegroupid=26) for AGPv3 available from panzea, for [shoot](http://de.iplantcollaborative.org/dl/d/E9018AC6-8460-4374-AF1C-4EABF92F1295/AP.bfthresh1.1.MNaseHS.Ranges.dat) and [root](http://de.iplantcollaborative.org/dl/d/4517FAAA-8969-4B43-AE2E-E1A91DD65BFB/RP.bfthresh1.1.MNaseHS.Ranges.dat). 

3. Zygotene meiocytes of B73 subjected to MNase treatment, no paper yet.
Summarized hypersensitive region [data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE84368&format=file&file=GSE84368%5Fpeaks%5Finformation%5Fcount%5Fratio%2Ebed%2Egz) on unknown genome version from NCBI GEO.
