### 1. Genetic properties of the MAGIC maize population: a new platform for high definition QTL mapping in Zea mays [o Dellâ€™Acqua, 2015](http://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0716-z)

#### Data summary:  
- **Study description**: 1,636 MAGIC maize recombinant inbred lines derived from 8 genetically diverse founder lines (A632, B73, B96, F7, H99, HP301, Mo17, W153R).
- **Genotypic Data**: GBS data of offspring and WGS of parents


### 2.Transcriptome analysis of 94 RILs of a maize MAGIC RIL population[DATA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB11400)

#### Data summary:
Description
In this study we used a maize multiparental advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population, originating from nine parental lines (A632, B73, B96, F7, H99, HP301, Mo17, W153R and CML91) followed by 6 generations of self-pollination. A subset of 94 lines was chosen randomly from the set of 529 lines that was genotyped and phenotyped in the field (Dell'Aqua et al (2015) Genome Biology, 16:167) and sampled for RNA seq of proliferative tissue of growing leaf.

**Transcriptome Data** proliferative tissue of growing leaf
