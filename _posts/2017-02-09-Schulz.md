### 1.The maize methylome influences mRNA splice sites and reveals widespread paramutation-like switches guided by small RNA [Regulski, et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3787262/)

#### Data Summary
- **Study description**:  A cytosine methylation genome-wide map for B73 and Mo17.
- **Genotypic Data**: Can be found on NBCA SRI - SRP014211
- **Sample Size**: Sample size is unknown  
- **Tissue**:  Shoots at coleoptilar stage

### 2.Extensive, clustered parental imprinting of protein-coding and noncoding RNAs in developing maize endosperm [Zhang et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250141/)

#### Data Summary
- **Study description**: This study looks at the regulation of genetic imprinting in maize endosperm and how it interacts with the trioloid tissue of the embryo
- **Genotypic Data**: Can be found on NBCA SRI -  SRP010160
- **Sample Size**:  Unknown sample size of maize lines Mo17, B73, Mo17 x B73, and B73 x Mo17
- **Tissue**: Seed and endosperm tissue was used
