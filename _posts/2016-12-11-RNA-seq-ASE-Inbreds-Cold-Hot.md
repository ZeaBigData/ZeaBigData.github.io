RNA-seq Allele Specific Expression datasets


------

### 1. Natural variation for gene expression responses to abiotic stress in maize data from [Waters et al., 2016](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13414/full)

#### Data summary:
- **Study description**: Study Allele Specific Expression on different F1s of inbreds B73, Mo17, Oh43, PH207, and B37 under control, cold, and heat conditions
- **SRA Project ID**: [PRJNA244661](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA244661) But it seems data from this paper in particular has not been deposited yet.
- **Sample Size**: Inbred B73, Mo17, Oh43, PH207, and B37 and hybrid F1s of B73 with each of the other inbreds under control, cold, and heat conditions.
- **Data Size**: Unknown
- **Tissue**: Above ground tissue of 14-day-old seedlings
- **Platform**: HiSeq2000
- **Phenotype**: No, just expression data.
