Some RNA-seq data sets for certain lines collected on different tissues or measured at different developmental stages.


------

### Developmental Atlas of maize

Paired RNA and peptide were collected from 23 tissues of B73 inbred.

- From [Walley et al., 2016](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6301/814.full).  
- **Study description from paper abstract**: "We built a large-scale gene expression atlas composed of 62,547 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), 17,862 nonmodified proteins, and 6227 phosphoproteins harboring 31,595 phosphorylation sites quantified across maize development."    
- **Transcriptome**: [FPKM](http://science.sciencemag.org/highwire/filestream/683104/field_highwire_adjunct_files/1/aag1125_SupportingFile_Table_S1.xlsx), (64 Mb excel file)    
- **Non-modified proteome**: [aNSAF](http://science.sciencemag.org/highwire/filestream/683104/field_highwire_adjunct_files/3/aag1125_SupportingFile_Table_S2.xlsx), (43 Mb excel file)  
- **Phosphoproteome**: [Spectral counts of both phosphopeptides and phosphoptroteins](http://science.sciencemag.org/highwire/filestream/683104/field_highwire_adjunct_files/4/aag1125_SupportingFile_Table_S3.xlsx), (98 Mb excel file)    


### RNA-Seq with diverse B73 tissues

FPKM matrices are available from the above paper.

- From [Stelpflug et al., 2015](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/articles/9/1/plantgenome2015.04.0025).
- **Study description**: Microarray versus RNA-Seq comparative analysis with diverse B73 tissues.
- **SRA Study ID**: [SRP010680](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP010680)
- **Data Size**: 50 Gbp; and 31Gb in size



### Dry seeds (0 hour) to hour 72 every six hours

- From [Liu et al., 2013](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/10/3979.full).  
- **Study description**: To discover the transcriptional dynamics during seed germination we
have obtained the time course transcriptomes for embryonic shoot apical meristem (SAM) every six hours, starting from dry seeds to hour 72 (3 days).
- **SRA Study ID**: [SRP017122](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP017122)
- **Data Size**: 1.4 Tbp; and 0.9Tb in size
- Zea mays subsp. mays strain: White Crystal


### Dry seeds (0 hour) to hour 192 from [Yu et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//pubmed/25918418).

- **Study description**: Using 22 transcriptomes of developing maize leaves from dry seeds to 192 h post imbibition,
we studied gene up- and down-regulation and functional transition during leaf development and inferred sets of strongly co-expressed genes.
- **SRA Study ID**: [SRP044069](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP044069)
- **Data Size**: 0.5 Tbp; and 0.3Tb in size
- Zea mays subsp. mays strain: White Crystal


### embryo (0 to 38 days), endosperm (6 to 38 days) and seed (0 to 28 days) every 2 hours (http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/early/2014/07/18/pp.114.240689).

- **Study description**: the expression profile among the development of maize embryo, endosperm and seed
- **SRA Study ID**: [SRP037559](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?WebEnv=NCID_1_50963555_130.14.22.76_5555_1486660269_3544543543_0MetA0_S_HStore&query_key=76)
- **Data Size**: 178.99 Gbp; and 112.14 Gb in size
- Zea mays subsp. mays strain: B73


### Unpollinated kernels (0 DAP), kernels at 3 and 5 DAP, and endo- sperms from 7, 10, and 15 DAP were obtained by hand dissection (http://www.plantcell.org/content/25/9/3212.long).

- **Study description**: we performed high- throughput transcriptome sequencing of whole kernels at 0, 3, and 5 d after pollination (DAP) and endosperms at 7, 10, and 15 DAP, using B73 by Mo17 reciprocal crosses.
- **SRA Study ID**: [GSE48425](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?WebEnv=NCID_1_50963555_130.14.22.76_5555_1486660269_3544543543_0MetA0_S_HStore&query_key=80)
