Several studies on maize natural variation of metabolomics traits.

### 1.Genomic and metabolic prediction of complex heterotic traits in hybrid maize from [Riedelsheimer et al., 2012](http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n2/abs/ng.1033.html)

#### Data summary:  
- **Study description**: 285 Dent inbreds crossed with two testers. Samples taken from plants grown in the field for metabolite analysis. Using ~56K SNPs and data from 130 metabolites authors calculate general combining abilities for 7 biomass and bioenergy related traits.  
- **Genotypic Data**: MaizeSNP50, data not available.  
- **Metabolite Data**: 130 metabolites measured (See supplementary material)[http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n2/extref/ng.1033-S1.pdf]. Raw data not provided.  
- **Sample Size**: 285 Dent inbreds testcrossed with two testers giving a total of 570 testcrosses.  In the trials of each of the three maturity groups, 100 genotypes, including five common check genotypes, were randomized in a 20 × 5 α-lattice design with two replications and were planted in 2-row plots.   
- **Tissue**:  5 cm cuts from fully developed third leaf collected 33 days after sowing.  

### 2.Genome-wide association mapping of leaf metabolic profiles for dissecting complex traits in maize from [Riedelsheimer et al., 2012](pnas.org/content/109/23/8872)

#### Data summary:
- **Study description**: 285 Dent inbreds. Samples taken from plants grown in the field for metabolite analysis. Authors perform GWAS analysis with the metabolite abundance data.  
- **Genotypic Data**: MaizeSNP50, data not available.  
- **Metabolite Data**: 130 metabolites measured. Raw data not provided.  
- **Sample Size**: 285 Dent inbreds and five additional 4 additional European Flint lines.  In the trials of each of the three maturity groups, 100 genotypes, including five common check genotypes, were randomized in a 20 × 5 α-lattice design with two replications and were planted in 2-row plots.  
- **Tissue**:  5 cm cuts from fully developed third leaf collected 33 days after sowing.  

### 3.The maize leaf lipidome shows multilevel genetic control and high predictive value for agronomic traits from [Riedelsheimer et al., 2013](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02479)

#### Data summary:  
- **Study description**: 285 Dent inbreds. Samples taken from plants grown in the field for metabolite analysis. Authors perform GWAS analysis with the lipidome abundance data.  
- **Genotypic Data**: MaizeSNP50, data not available.  
- **Metabolite Data**: 563 lipids measured. Raw data not provided. Average mean intensity for each of the lipids can be found on the [supplementary pdf](http://www.nature.com/article-assets/npg/srep/2013/130821/srep02479/extref/srep02479-s1.pdf)  
- **Sample Size**: 285 Dent inbreds and five additional 4 additional European Flint lines.  In the trials of each of the three maturity groups, 100 genotypes, including five common check genotypes, were randomized in a 20 × 5 α-lattice design with two replications and were planted in 2-row plots.
