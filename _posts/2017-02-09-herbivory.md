Datasets measuring differential expression in the face of herbivory

### 1.Analysis of key genes of jasmonic acid mediated signal pathway for defense against insect damages by comparative transcriptome sequencing from [Yang et al. 2015](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16500)

#### Data summary:  
- **Study description**: The authors investigated changes in gene expression due to treatment with Asian corn borer larvae, Jasmonic acid, or both. 
- **Accession**: Longdan46
- **Transcriptomic Data**: Available on SRA: SRP072893
- **Sample Size**: 4 (1 per treatment)
- **Tissue**: Leaf (3rd leaf from bottom of plant)

### 2.Dynamic Maize Responses to Aphid Feeding Are Revealed by a Time Series of Transcriptomic and Metabolomic Assays from [Tzin et al. 2015](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/169/3/1727.short)

#### Data summary:  
- **Study description**: They evaluated the transcriptional response of corn leaves to being eaten by corn leaf aphids by measuring leaf expression at various time points before and after aphids were introduced (2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours)
- **Accession**: B73
- **Transcriptomic Data**: Available on SRA: PRJNA295410
- **Sample Size**: 40 (5 reps per time point)
- **Tissue**: Leaf
