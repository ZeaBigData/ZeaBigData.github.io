Chromatin immuniprecipitation using an antibody to H3K27me3, a repressive chromatin mark.

## H3K27me3 ChIP-seq

1. To assess the duration of S-phase, [Mickelson-Young et al. 2016](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jxb/erw367) pulse-labeled B73 seedling roots with EdU (a thymine analog). 
On nuclei from the root tip (0-3 mm) sorted by flow cytometry to find actively dividing cells, they performed ChIP-seq 
Summarized data not available, 101 bp paired end reads from three biological replicates and input available in [SRP077760](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP077760).

2. To characterize imprinting, [Zhang et al. 2014](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/1/167) investigate epigenetic and transcriptomic differences between B73 and MO17 and their bidirectional hybrids.
They perform H3K27me3 ChIP-seq on 12 days after pollination endosperm from hybrids [Mo17xB73](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR748862) and [B73xMo17](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR748861), which is available as 36bp single end reads.
Summarized data is not available, and no ChIP input is deposited.
RNA-seq and bisulfite sequence is available for these samples in [SRP011991](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRP011991).

3. As an early investigation into the epigenome of maize, [Wang et al. 2009](http://www.plantcell.org/content/21/4/1053.long) characterize several histone modifications alongside small RNA and mRNA pools.
[Shoot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX012384[accn]) and [root](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX012384[accn]) 35 bp single end reads from 14 day seedlings is available, no ChIP input is deposited.
Summarized data mapped to unknown genome version and of unclear format [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSM381699&format=file&file=GSM381699%5FH3K27me3%5FMQ00%5F50%5Fpeaks%2Ebed%2Egz)
