We define a unique ID for each accession. 
To avoid further confusion with the existing ID, the accession ID should be obtainable, e.g. from GRIN.
But in our naming system, we only allow capitalized letters and numbers. Any other characters will be replaces with NONE, including spaces, underscores, dashes, commas, etc. 

For example,
- "PI 1234" => "PI1234"
- "Clze_3" => "CLZE3"

In `R`, it will allow us to merge data by this unique ID.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
uid <- toupper(gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "", uid))
```
